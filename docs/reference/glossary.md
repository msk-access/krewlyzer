| **Linker DNA** | DNA between spools | The ~20bp of DNA connecting adjacent nucleosomes |
| **Mono-nucleosomal** | One wrapped loop | Fragment derived from a single nucleosome (~145-180bp) |
| **Di-nucleosomal** | Two wrapped loops | Fragment spanning two nucleosomes (~300-340bp) |

### Fragment Characteristics

| Term | Plain English | Technical Definition |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Fragment** | One piece of DNA | A single cfDNA molecule with defined start and end positions |
| **Fragment length** | DNA piece size | The number of base pairs from the 5' end to 3' end of a fragment |
| **End motif** | Cutting pattern | The 4-nucleotide sequence at the 5' end of a fragment |
| **Breakpoint motif** | Internal cut | The sequence context where a fragment was cut |

### Genomic Context

| Term | Plain English | Technical Definition |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Chromosome arm** | Half of a chromosome | The p (short) or q (long) arm of a chromosome, separated by the centromere |
| **GC content** | Letter composition | The percentage of G (guanine) and C (cytosine) bases in a sequence |
| **Open chromatin** | Accessible DNA | Genomic regions not tightly wrapped, allowing transcription factor access |
| **TSS** | Gene start site | Transcription Start Site - where RNA polymerase begins transcribing |
| **CTCF site** | DNA organizer | CCCTC-binding factor sites that organize 3D chromatin structure |
| **Alu element** | Repeated sequence | A ~300bp repetitive element found ~1 million times in the human genome |

## Sequencing & Alignment Terms

### Read Processing

| Term | Plain English | Technical Definition |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **BAM file** | Aligned sequences | Binary Alignment Map - compressed file containing sequencing reads aligned to a reference genome |
| **Read** | Sequenced chunk | A single sequence generated by the sequencer (R1 = forward, R2 = reverse) |
| **Read pair** | Two matching reads | R1 and R2 reads from the same DNA fragment (paired-end sequencing) |
| **Proper pair** | Good alignment | Read pair where both reads align correctly in expected orientation and distance |
| **MAPQ** | Alignment confidence | Mapping quality - Phred-scaled probability that alignment position is wrong |
| **Duplicate** | PCR copy | Multiple reads from the same original molecule (amplification artifact) |

### Quality Thresholds

| Setting | Plain English | Krewlyzer Default |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **MAPQ ≥ 20** | High confidence alignment | 99% probability alignment is correct |
| **Min length 65bp** | Not too short | Excludes fragments smaller than most cfDNA |
| **Max length 400bp** | Not too long | Excludes di-nucleosomal and larger fragments |
| **Skip duplicates** | Remove PCR copies | Ensures each molecule counted once |
| **Require proper pair** | Good read pairs only | May need to disable for duplex/consensus BAMs |

## Krewlyzer Feature Terms

### Fragment Size Features

| Feature | Measures | Higher Value Means |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **FSC** (Coverage) | Fragment count per genomic bin | More fragments in that region |
| **FSR** (Ratio) | Short ÷ Long fragment ratio | More tumor-derived DNA |
| **FSD** (Distribution) | Size histogram per arm | (Shape matters, not value) |

### Size Bin Definitions (Rust Backend)

| Bin Name | Size Range | Biological Meaning |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **ultra_short** | 65-99bp | Sub-nucleosomal, TF footprints |
| **core_short** | 100-149bp | Tumor-enriched (primary biomarker) |
| **mono_nucl** | 150-259bp | Standard mono-nucleosomal cfDNA |
| **di_nucl** | 260-399bp | Di-nucleosomal and larger |
| **long** | 400+bp | Very long fragments (rare) |

### Nucleosome Features

| Feature | Measures | Higher Value Means |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **WPS** | Protection score at each position | Nucleosome present (positive) or absent (negative) |
| **NRL** | Nucleosome Repeat Length | Expected ~190bp; deviation suggests abnormality |
| **nrl_quality** | Periodicity strength (0-1) | Clearer nucleosome spacing pattern |

### Other Features

| Feature | Measures | Higher Value Means |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **MDS** | Motif Diversity Score | More diverse (potentially tumor-related) end motifs |
| **OCF** | Orientation asymmetry | Tissue-specific fragmentation pattern |
| **mFSD** | Mutant vs wild-type sizes | ALT shorter than REF = ctDNA present |

### GC Correction

| Term | Plain English | Technical Definition |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **GC bias** | Uneven amplification | PCR/capture preferentially amplifies certain GC contents |
| **LOESS** | Smoothing algorithm | Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing - fits local regression curves |
| **Correction factor** | Adjustment weight | Multiplier to remove GC-related count biases |

### Panel of Normals (PON)

| Term | Plain English | Technical Definition |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **PON** | Healthy baseline | Panel of Normals - reference statistics from healthy samples |
| **Z-score** | Deviation from normal | (Sample - PON_mean) / PON_std; measures abnormality |
| **Log-ratio** | Relative change | log₂(Sample / PON_expected); positive = elevated |
